Simple Node.js website crawler that users either the ?SHOWXML or the sitemap.xml of a site to crawler through looking for blank pages, and other bad status codes

## To Do
* Combine the CLI repo with this one and have 2 components, 1 public facing and 1 CLI using the same components but handling the view differently. [thanks Jackie!]
* Allow user to enter in site url instead of having to adding it through the server.js file.
* Redesign the UI
* Rework to just use express.js?
